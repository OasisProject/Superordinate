#Superordinate
A serious attempt at defining a set of standards for a high-performing, up to date and highly compatible paid binary linux distribution.  


##Linux Sucks!
Seriously. anyone who has worked on both Linux and Macintosh knows the awful truth:  Linux is terrible on the desktop, even or perhaps especially for developers.  In addition to being a linux distribution, this is also a set of guidelines for developers who want to follow standards for creation on the linux desktop.  There's a bias towards the gnome way around here, but we're open to anyone who is willing to take the lead in the standards department.  We're favoring new packages, such as rust and go system utilities, and shipping with the very latest docker.  

##Foundational Principles
 * KISS
 * We are building a tool that our users will use in every facet of their lives as they go about their goal of creating a better society on the planet earth and beyond.
 * We're going to configure one and only one desktop environment for this distro.  If you want to fork and do your own, well we are very happy for you to do that.  Right now, it looks to be GNOME, but Pantheon isn't looking half-bad, either.
 * We're going to enforce a consistent set of programming and design principles across the board for the UI, enabling the sort of efficiency seen in Apple's Cocoa.
 * Principles of conflict:
 1 If it ain't broke, don't fix it
 2 Bias towards the new and well designed.  
 * This distribution will cost money in binary form, because it is Linux for getting work done.  
 * We will support a positive, helpful community with the goal of building a community famed for its openness, cheeriness, and supportive nature.  
 * Devs will get paid.  The distro itself will never keep more money in its coffers than is needed to ensure that it has enough "brain resources" to keep up with package updates and community maintenance.  If it is possible, we will pay developers higher than industry standard wages, and boast about it.  If you do a little work on our distro, expect a little money, and an ongoing crypto-asset backed stake (ownership + voting) in the project.  It's our way of saying "why yes, we do know where code comes from!"  If for some reason a dev doesn't want to be paid, their payment will be sent directly to their choice of aligned advocacy organization.
 * Only one installation process (instead of installing, then updating, then installing, then configuring) should stand between a user and their work.
 * Thoughtful form over thoughtless function
 * unlimited portability
 * Beautiful!  This distro must look, feel and perform better than any other.
 * Universal Deploy targeting-- we aim to be omni-platform and omni-device segment.  
 * We are conscious of the fact that we are designing tools that shape societies and are therefore painstakingly careful to make socially positive design a feature of every product and project.

##100% optional Cloud connections that provide conveinence, worldwide access, AND respect a user's essential freedoms
 * Encrypted backup tools for Google Nearline
 * Ditto for S3
 * Ditto for OwnCloud
 *
 * Essentially, users can back up into public clouds WITHOUT worry-- their traffic and data will be heavily encrypted.  
 * Dotfile backup and imports

When you Download Superordinate, you're downloading an image freshly made for you at a fair price, or compiling one yourself.  Let's see where this goes :).  For now, it's debian-based, but this could change as we move forward.  We're aiming to make this the most portable linux distro with a full GUI out there.  It can also be the most portable distro without a full GUI.  We are planning to release open hardware devices on which to run our decidedly superieor operating system, including:

##Planned hardware
 * Smartphone
 * Laptop
 * Development board
 * Tablet PC
 * StickPC
 * Compute Module
 * Router
 * Open Hardware Open Source Switch

##Other Objects
 * Portable Computer Workstation
 * A modular server
 * Greenhouses
 * Indoor Farming
 * Apartments
 * Additive Manufacturing
 * Drones
 * Drone Swarms
 * Electric Vehicles
 * Personal Aircraft
 * Space Prospectors
 * Alternative Energy Systems

#Token Scheme
 * All devs are given an ownership stake in the project
 * All investors and donors will recieve tokens also
 * All paying users will be given tokens

#Payments
 * We will accept any cryptocurrency or crypto asset with a total value >250,000USD
 * We will not accept payments from teachers.  They will be given the full edition at no cost.  
 * Users facing financial difficulty will also be given no-cost access to our binaries.  
 * Individuals who advocate for Superordinate will be thanked in token form.
 * Companies meeting our soon to be published standards for ethical business practices will be given a reduced price.  
 * Users with >10 referrals will recieve 3 months free for each 10 referrals.  

#Timeline
 * Project is currently in the early planning stages, with a debian-based framework on the way.
