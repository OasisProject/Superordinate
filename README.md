# linux
A serious attempt at defining a set of standards for a high-performing, up to date and highly compatible paid binary linux distribution.  


##Linux Sucks!
Seriously. anyone who has worked on both Linux and Macintosh knows the awful truth:  Linux is terrible on the desktop, even or perhaps especially for developers.  In addition to being a linux distribution, this is also a set of guidelines for developers who want to follow standards for creation on the linux desktop.  There's a bias towards the gnome way around here, but we're open to anyone who is willing to take the lead in the standards department.  We're favoring new packages, such as rust and go system utilities, and shipping with the very latest docker.  

##Linux, without the pain

Here are some things that run well from the very start in this highly opinionated distro:

 * fish
 * rust
 * go
 * nvm
 * npm
 * rvm
 * rbvm
 * docker
 * docker-compose
 * exa
 * gulp
 * rust
 * multirust
 * crate
 * haskell
 * Rancher
 * rkt
 * python3
 * php56
 * laravel
 * jdk8
 * vmware free
 * virtualbox
 * boxes
 * qemu
 
When you Download LINUX! you're downloading an image freshly made for you, or downloading one yourself.  Images are a buck.  Let's see where this goes :).
