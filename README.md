#Superordinate
A serious attempt at defining a set of standards for a high-performing, up to date and highly compatible paid binary linux distribution.  

Superordinate has been canceled because SOLUS linux does everything we'd planned for superordinate.  Please [support](https://solus-project.com/) them with your wallets and ideas.  

We like Solus so much that in the coming weeks we hope to create a plan to modularize their distro so that our mobile efforts can use their kernel and package manager.  No phablets here! ...... (yet ;) )
